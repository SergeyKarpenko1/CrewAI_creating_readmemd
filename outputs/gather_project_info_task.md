# Project Information: README.md Generator

## Project Overview

Based on the directory scan, this project appears to be a README.md generator tool built using CrewAI framework. The project is structured as a Python package named "readmemd" that likely uses AI agents to automatically generate README.md files for projects.

```

## Technologies and Dependencies

From the project structure and file types, the project appears to use:

1. **Python**: The main programming language
2. **CrewAI**: Framework for creating AI agent workflows
3. **YAML**: For configuration of agents and tasks
4. **Environment Variables**: For configuration through `.env` file

The `requirements.txt` file likely contains the specific Python package dependencies.

## Project Components

### Main Components

1. **crew.py (3496 bytes)**: Contains the main CrewAI implementation, likely defining the agents and their interactions
2. **main.py (1741 bytes)**: Entry point of the application
3. **custom_tool.py (2032 bytes)**: Custom tools for the CrewAI agents
4. **agents.yaml (4739 bytes)**: Configuration for different AI agents
5. **tasks.yaml (8944 bytes)**: Definitions of tasks to be performed by the agents

### Configuration

1. **.env file**: Contains environment variables for the project
2. **pyproject.toml**: Python project metadata and build system configuration
3. **user_preference.txt**: Contains user preferences for README generation

## Project Purpose

This project appears to be designed to automatically generate README.md files for software projects. It likely:

1. Analyzes a given project directory
2. Extracts key information about the project
3. Uses AI agents (via CrewAI) to generate appropriate README.md content
4. Customizes the output based on user preferences

The system is structured with different agents (defined in agents.yaml) performing specific tasks (defined in tasks.yaml) in a workflow to achieve the README generation goal.

## Setup and Configuration

The project uses:
- A `.env` file for environment variables
- `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies
- `pyproject.toml` for package configuration

To install and run the project, one would likely:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the `.env` file
4. Run the application with `python -m readmemd.main` or similar command

## Additional Notes

- The project follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- It uses YAML for configuration, allowing for easy modification of agent behaviors and tasks
- There's a knowledge directory that likely stores information to guide the README generation process
- The tools directory contains custom implementations for specific functionalities

This appears to be a well-structured CrewAI application focused on automating the creation of README.md documentation through AI agents.
